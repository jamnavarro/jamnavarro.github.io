                As a solo UX researcher and designer in this project, I am conducting competitive
                analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and usability studies on my own.
            </div>

            <div class="header-text">Project Background & Overview</div>
            <div class="body-text">
                I really enjoy reading, and I wanted to create a simple mobile app that can easily
                organize books into a combined virtual bookshelf and journal.
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
                The purpose of this project is primarily to explore higher level interactive and
                responsive Figma prototyping and serve as an exercise in conducting usability studies.

            <div class="body-text">
                I conducted a competitive analysis of similar library management and reading tracker
                applications, including Bookshelf, libib, BookBuddy, and Goodreads.
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
                As an overview, the key feature that direct competitors offered was the option of adding
                books to a list, using barcode scanning, manual searching or adding, and ISBN lookup.
                Other features across the both indirect and direct competitors included reviews, book and
                genre recommendations, and wishlists.
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
                From these audits, I narrowed down two features to highlight in this design:
                <li>
                    Personal Tags
                </li>

                I created hand drawn wireframes that served as a reference for the first iteration of a low

                settings, and various features in a book overview screen.

                I conducted a round of usability testing and three iterations of prototypes, developing more
                comprehensive prototyping and creating possible solutions to pain points that I discovered at
                every step. Both iterations were tested by different users.

                Above is the basic layout of the wireframe as a base. The first iteration includes basic
                prototyped animations and flows, optimized for testing by providing feedback when specific
                tasks are completed.
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
                I used Maze to conduct rounds of usability testing. The tasks were as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>Turn on Dark Mode.</li>
                    <li>Add a new shelf and title it, "Wishlist".</li>
                    <li>Search for <i>The Hobbit</i> and add it to the shelf, "To Read".</li>
                    <li>Edit the typo in the first note for the book, <i>Educated.</i></li>
                    <li>Add a "Memoir" tag to <i>Educated.</i></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
                Overall, it seemed that users became more comfortable with the layout of the prototype as
                the usability study continued. I compiled a summary of feedback from specific user comments
                as well as user reports and heatmaps. I also included solutions to minimize pain points in
                the next iteration of this prototype.

                    Swiping/dragging option in onboarding pages was less intuitive than tapping. Users tried

                    New shelf addition path had too many screens. Users were confused about where to add a new

                I was very satisfied with my goal of getting a more in-depth experience with Figma prototyping
                and Maze usability testing. I wish I could have used some Figma features more extensively, like
                variants, plugins, and generated code snippets that are very useful in translating work to
                developers.
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
                It was very useful to divide up prototyping into three sections, since each iteration could
                focus on different aspects of the application's design. Attempting to fix all the issues that I
                discovered in only a single test would have been a lot more difficult.
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
                While this application design is fairly minimal, there are a lot of other features that I would
                love to include if I were to continue working on this design project in the future, including in
                depth reading statistics, custom book recommendations, or visual personalizations.
