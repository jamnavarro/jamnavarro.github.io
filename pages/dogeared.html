							Project Background & Overview
						</div>

						<div class="body-text">
							I really enjoy reading, and I wanted to create a simple mobile app that can easily organize books into a combined virtual bookshelf and journal.
							<br>
							<br>
							The purpose of this project is primarily to explore higher level interactive and responsive Figma prototyping and serve as an exercise in conducting usability studies.

							Qualitative Competitive Analysis
						</div>
			
						<div class="body-text">
							I conducted a competitive analysis of similar library management and reading tracker applications, including Bookshelf, libib, BookBuddy, and Goodreads.
							<br>
							<br>
							As an overview, the key feature that direct competitors offered was the option of adding books to a list, using barcode scanning, manual searching or adding, and ISBN lookup. Other features across the both indirect and direct competitors included reviews, book and genre recommendations, and wishlists.
							<br>
							<br>
							From these audits, I narrowed down two features to highlight in this design:
							<li>
								Personal Tags
							</li>
							<li>
								Custom Annotations/Notes
							</li>

						<div class="body-text">
							I created hand drawn wireframes that served as a reference for the first iteration of a low fidelity prototype. It includes a bookshelf and expanded shelf section, a search function, settings, and various features in a book overview screen.

							Prototyping & Testing
						</div>
			
						<div class="body-text">
							I conducted a round of usability testing and three iterations of prototypes, developing more comprehensive prototyping and creating possible solutions to pain points that I discovered at every step. Both iterations were tested by different users.

							First Iteration
						</div>
			
						<div class="body-text">
							Above is the basic layout of the wireframe as a base. The first iteration includes basic prototyped animations and flows, optimized for testing by providing feedback when specific tasks are completed.
							<br>
							<br>
							I used Maze to conduct rounds of usability testing. The tasks were as follows:
							<br>
							<br>
							<ol>
								<li>Turn on Dark Mode.</li>
								<li>Add a new shelf and title it, "Wishlist".</li>
								<li>Search for The Hobbit and add it to the shelf, "To Read".</li>
								<li>Edit the typo in the first note for the book, Educated.</li>
								<li>Add a "Memoir" tag to Educated.</li>
							</ol>
							<br>
							<br>
							Overall, it seemed that users became more comfortable with the layout of the prototype as the usability study continued. I compiled a summary of feedback from specific user comments as well as user reports and heatmaps. I also included solutions to minimize pain points in the next iteration of this prototype.

							Swiping/dragging option in onboarding pages was less intuitive than tapping. Users tried tapping on the page indicators at the bottom or around the page.

						<div class="subheader-text">
							Add multiple prototype flow options to access next pages.
						</div>

						<div class="body-text">
							Option to edit text was misleading. Users had some trouble trying to edit by selecting the text itself.

						<div class="body-text">
							New shelf addition path had too many screens. Users were confused about where to add a new shelf, and many had indirect success with the task, accessing an average of four incorrect pages before following the expected path.

						<div class="subheader-text">
							Swiping and Scrolling

						<div class="body-text">
							I included more tapping options for prototype flows in the onboarding pages and open text fields.

							Number of Taps
						</div>
						<div class="body-text">
							For both shelf and book addition, I reduced the extra taps by including CTA buttons in the main bookshelf page, eliminating the need to access these buttons in later screens.

							Readability

						<div class="body-text">
							To avoid only relying on book cover information, I enlarged the book covers and included titles and authors on the bookshelf page for more accessibility. Changes were also made to implement an information hierarchy to draw the eye towards certain shelves and reduce cognitive load.

							Reflections & Future Considerations
						</div>
						<div class="body-text">
							I was very satisfied with my goal of getting a more in-depth experience with Figma prototyping and Maze usability testing. I wish I could have used some Figma features more extensively, like variants, plugins, and generated code snippets that are very useful in translating work to developers.
							<br>
							<br>
							It was useful to divide up prototyping into three sections, since each iteration could focus on different aspects of the application's design. Attempting to fix all the issues that I discovered in only a single test would have been a lot more difficult.
							<br>
							<br>
							While this application design is fairly minimal, there are a lot of other features that I would love to include if I were to continue working on this design project in the future, including in depth reading statistics, custom book recommendations, or visual personalizations.
