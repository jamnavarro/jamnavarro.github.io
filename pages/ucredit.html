                        I understand now from personal experience that interviews are a long and complex endeavor. It's good to be able to
                        explain to yourself and your stakeholders <b>why it's worth spending time and effort on.</b>

                        The recruitment and interview process took over two 2-week sprints, which was longer than we had initially anticipated.

                        During this project, my team encouraged me to make sure I back up any solutions I thought of with research. This is a 
                        great skill for me to continue building and learn to <b>move away from making isolated design choices</b> that might not
                        be great for the users I'm designing for.
