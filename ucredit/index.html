                <p>UCredit's main features include a planning dashboard and a reviewer dashboard. From previous heuristic evaluation data, working on improving the reviewer dashboard was an important step for the platform's future.</p>

                <h2>My role</h2>
                <p>I worked with one partner on this project. Together, we created a research plan, recruited, conducted, and took notes for user interviews. My personal work included processing the interview research data after affinity diagramming to determine action items, as well as conducting competitive research from various direct competitors.</p>

                <p>By learning from the past user feedback in internal secondary research data, we understood some of our target demographics that would potentially use the reviewer dashboard.</p>
                <p>We needed to explore two major user groups:</p>

                <h2>Lessons to learn</h2>
                <h3>Know the motivations in conducting user research methods.</h3>
                <p>I understand now from personal experience that interviews are a long and complex endeavor. It's good to be able to explain to yourself and your stakeholders why it's worth spending time and effort on.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Be smart about organizing interviews.</h3>
                <p>The recruitment and interview process took over two 2-week sprints, which was longer than we had initially anticipated. For future considerations, I know now to always request to interview more people than you expect.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Always justify design decisions.</h3>
                <p>During this project, my team encouraged me to make sure I back up any solutions I thought of with research. This is a great skill for me to continue building and learn to move away from making isolated design choices that might not be great for the users I'm designing for.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Be proactive about next steps.</h3>
                <p>Especially for a startup, it's crucial to know what the team should be able to improve next and make this kind of research really count in the same way our secondary research really helped our process. My own possible next steps for my role on the UCredit UX team included in-depth reviewer dashboard wireframing and prototyping, as well as focusing on the interaction between students and trying to increase the collaboration and community of peers on the platform.</p>
