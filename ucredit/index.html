                <p>UCredit's main features include a planning dashboard and a reviewer dashboard. From previous heuristic evaluation data, working on improving the reviewer dashboard was an important step for the platform's future.</p>

                <p>I worked with one partner on this project. Together, we created a research plan, recruited, conducted, and took notes for user interviews. My personal work included processing the interview research data after affinity diagramming to determine action items, as well as conducting competitive research from various direct competitors.</p>

                <p>By learning from the past user feedback in internal secondary research data, we understood some of our target demographics that would potentially use the reviewer dashboard.</p>
                <p>We needed to explore two major user groups:</p>

                <h2>My role</h2>
                <h3>We first wanted to understand how users were currently navigating the existing reviewer dashboard.</h3>

                </div>

                <p>To do this, we found it beneficial to conduct a competitive analysis to identify spaces that UCredit could expand upon as well as guided usability tests with user interviews to directly see how advisors are currently checking requirements and communicating with advisees.</p>

                <p>Qualitative KPIs were gathered from any comments or feedback an interview participant made during the study. <i>What did they do? What did they feel? What did they say?</i></p>
                <p>Post-study, we gathered each participant's consumer effort score (CES), net promoter score (NPS), and scores on a system usability scale (SUS) by asking them to rate some statements on their experience.</p>
